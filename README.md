# Build-A-New-Node-Project
## Setting up a Node project
1. Create a new folder for your project

```
mkdir my-node-project
```
2. Initilize NPM inside the project folder 
(shortcut: add -y to agree to all conditions)

```
 npm init -y
```
3. Make your entry file

```
touch index.js
```
4. Run your program
There is two ways:
```
node index.js
```
Or you can use `nodemon` it acts like a live server for node (It simply restarts the node application whenever it observes the changes in the file present in the working directory of your project.)
```
nodemon
```
